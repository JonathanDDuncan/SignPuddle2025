# SPML Import Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED FEATURES

### Core Implementation
- **SPML Data Models**: `SpmlModels.cs` with XML serialization support
- **Import Service**: `SpmlImportService.cs` implementing `ISpmlImportService`
- **REST API Controller**: `SPMLController.cs` with file upload endpoints
- **Dependency Injection**: Service registered in `Program.cs`

### Functionality
- Parse SPML XML files with DTD validation disabled
- Convert SPML documents to Dictionary objects
- Convert SPML entries to Sign collections
- Extract FSW notation and gloss from entries
- Preserve user attribution and timestamps
- Handle various content types (text, video, source attribution)

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/spml/import` - Import SPML file directly
- `POST /api/spml/preview` - Preview SPML file contents before import

### Test Coverage
- **32 passing tests** across multiple test classes:
  - `SpmlImportServiceTests.cs` - 15+ unit tests (no mocking libraries used)
  - `SpmlImportIntegrationTests.cs` - 6 integration tests  
  - Controller endpoints tested via SignPuddle.API.E2ETests project

## üîß TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Data Processing
- **Unix Timestamp Conversion**: Correctly converts to UTC DateTime
- **FSW Notation Extraction**: Identifies SignWriting notation patterns
- **Language Mapping**: Maps SPML types to language codes
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and exception handling

### Test Data
- Uses `sgn4-small.spml` with 10 sign entries
- Tests various entry types (with/without video, text, source)
- Validates 3 unique users: "Val", "admin", "174.59.122.20"
- Covers timestamp preservation and data integrity

### Architecture
- **Service Layer**: Clean separation of concerns
- **Repository Pattern**: Ready for database integration
- **Async/Await**: Non-blocking I/O operations
- **Dependency Injection**: Proper IoC container setup

## üöÄ READY FOR INTEGRATION

The SPML import functionality is fully implemented and tested. Next steps for production use:

1. **Database Integration**: Implement actual persistence in repositories
2. **File Upload UI**: Create frontend components for file upload
3. **User Authentication**: Add proper user context for imports
4. **Batch Processing**: Handle large SPML files efficiently
5. **Import History**: Track import operations and results

## üìä TEST RESULTS
```
Test summary: total: 32, failed: 0, succeeded: 32, skipped: 0
‚úÖ All tests passing!
```

## üîç SPML File Structure Supported
- Dictionary metadata (name, language, timestamps)
- Entry collections with IDs and user attribution
- FSW notation extraction from terms
- Gloss text extraction
- Optional fields: text descriptions, video embeds, source attribution
- Unix timestamp conversion to UTC DateTime objects

# SPML Import Summary

## Import Approach

- **Incremental Import:**
  - SPML files will be imported one at a time, not as a full migration.
  - The import process is designed to be repeatable for the same SPML file (e.g., for periodic updates).
  - On each import, the system will check for new or modified entries in the SPML and update the database accordingly.
  - This allows you to periodically fetch the latest version of an SPML file and synchronize only the changes (additions/updates) to your database.

## Workflow

1. **User uploads or provides an SPML file.**
2. **System parses the SPML and compares entries to the current database state.**
3. **New entries are added; modified entries are updated.**
4. **No full-database migration is performed.**
5. **This process can be repeated as new SPML versions become available.**

## Notes
- This approach supports ongoing dictionary maintenance and incremental updates.
- It is suitable for workflows where the SPML source is updated over time and you want to keep your database in sync without re-importing everything.
